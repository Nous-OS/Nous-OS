# ETHICS.md — Nous-OS Ethical Principles

---

## Core Mission

Nous-OS exists to support self-reflection, therapy preparation, and inner work — not to replace human connection or therapeutic relationships.  
We build this system to serve people ethically, transparently, and with full respect for privacy.

---

## Core Ethical Commitments

- **Therapy-Supportive, Not Therapy-Replacing**  
  Nous-OS assists users in preparing for and reflecting on therapeutic processes.  
  It is never intended to substitute qualified professional therapy.

- **Privacy-First Architecture**  
  - All data remains local and fully encrypted.
  - No cloud storage, no data harvesting, no commercial tracking.
  - No third-party analytics, telemetry, or external APIs without full user consent.

- **Full Data Sovereignty**  
  Users own, control, and manage all their personal data.  
  Exports, deletions, and backups remain fully in user hands.

- **Offline-First Design**  
  Nous-OS is fully functional offline.  
  Network connections are optional, not required.

- **Open-Source Transparency**  
  All source code is publicly available and auditable.  
  External contributors are held to the same ethical standards.

- **No Monetization of Personal Data**  
  Nous-OS will never monetize user data or create revenue streams based on personal information.

## AI Use Commitments

- **Offline AI Models Only (By Default)**  
  AI functions run locally using open-source models (e.g. LLaMA.cpp, DeepSeek, Whisper.cpp).
  
- **No Automated Decision Making**  
  AI suggestions serve as reflective prompts only.  
  No diagnoses, risk assessments, or automated evaluations are performed.

- **No Therapeutic Authority**  
  AI reflections never replace human judgment or clinical expertise.

- **Respect for Inner Complexity**  
  Nous-OS respects that the human mind cannot be reduced to data points or simplified models.

## Human-Centered Design

Nous-OS is designed to:

- Support personal growth.
- Facilitate safe self-exploration.
- Reduce digital overstimulation.
- Empower users in their own therapeutic journey.
- Always recognize the irreplaceable role of real human connection.

*Nous-OS is not simply software.  
It is a protected space — where technology supports, but never replaces, the human soul.*
