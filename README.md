# Nous-OS

**A psychotherapeutic, privacy-focused, offline-first Linux distribution for conscious self-reflection, built by a psychologist.**

---

## 🧠 Vision

Nous-OS is more than just an operating system.  
It’s a *digital safe space* — a second, separate OS you intentionally boot into when taking time for yourself.

- A protected room for inner work
- Inspired by psychotherapy and psychoanalysis
- Designed as a modern "transitional object" for psychological reflection
- No distractions. No surveillance. No cloud.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- Dual-boot friendly: intentionally separate from your daily OS
- Offline-first: full data ownership, no cloud dependencies
- Full system encryption & privacy by default
- Voice-based interaction with optional STT/TTS
- Integrated AI-Coach (offline-capable, local models)
- Journaling, breathing exercises, self-reflection tools, psychoeducation
- Gentle UI/UX designed to promote calm, not overload
- Visual and auditory rituals when booting into the system
- Built for Raspberry Pi, Laptops, and PCs (x86 / ARM)

---

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- Arch Linux base (highly reproducible & stable)
- XFCE or lightweight window managers (bspwm / i3 planned)
- Custom offline-capable AI modules (DeepSeek, Whisper.cpp, Llama.cpp, optional ChatGPT API)
- Fully encrypted local storage
- Hardware targets: Raspberry Pi 5 (initial), generic PC hardware (laptops, desktops)

---

## 💡 Usage Concept

- On Raspberry Pi: standalone installation on dedicated hardware — a fully isolated device for maximum privacy.
- On Laptops and PCs: installed alongside your main operating system (dual-boot), intentionally entered when you take time for self-reflection.
- Booting into Nous-OS becomes a deliberate, ritualized transition into your personal inner space.

- Embedded version (Pi 5) → prototype running  
- Laptop/Desktop version → roadmap in progress

Community contributions, testers, and collaborators are warmly welcome.
