## üß† What is Nous-OS?

Nous-OS is a dedicated Linux-based operating system designed to serve as a personal laboratory for self-reflection, structured journaling, and therapeutic support. It helps individuals explore their inner world while respecting the essential role of real human connection in therapy.

- Structure your thoughts, dreams, emotions and self-observations.
- Prepare and accompany psychotherapy processes.
- Become an active researcher of your own mind.
- Fully offline, fully encrypted, fully under your control.

## üí° Therapeutic Purpose

Nous-OS serves as:

- **Preparation space** ‚Äî organize topics before entering therapy.
- **Accompanying space** ‚Äî journal between therapy sessions.
- **Post-therapy tool** ‚Äî continue self-care and insight after therapy.
- **Stabilization resource** ‚Äî breathing, meditation and regulation exercises.

It is not a therapy substitute, but a powerful complement to human therapeutic work.
