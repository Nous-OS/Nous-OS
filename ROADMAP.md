# Nous-OS ‚Äî Development Roadmap

---

## üß† Mission Summary

Nous-OS is a **non-clinical, non-diagnostic, privacy-first operating system** for self-reflection, journaling, emotional self-structuring, and biographical work.

It creates a protected laboratory for personal exploration ‚Äî fully offline, fully user-owned, fully transparent.  
Nous-OS does not replace therapy, simulate therapists, or offer any medical or diagnostic functions.

All development follows the ethical charter (`ETHICS.md`).

## üöÄ Current Development Phases

### Phase 1 ‚Äî Core System Foundation

- Arch Linux base setup (stable & reproducible)
- Lightweight desktop environments (XFCE, bspwm, i3)
- Full-disk encryption (LUKS)
- Local journaling database structure
- Initial LaTeX report generation for printable journals
- Raspberry Pi 5 compatibility (embedded version)
- Generic PC/Laptop support (dual-boot option)
- Full offline AI model integration:
  - DeepSeek
  - LLaMA.cpp
  - Whisper.cpp
- Fully offline operation (no cloud dependency)

---

### Phase 2 ‚Äî Reflection & Stabilization Modules

- Structured journaling prompts:
  - Thoughts
  - Emotions
  - Dreams
  - Body sensations
  - Free journaling
  - Self-reflection prompts (strictly non-directive)
- Stabilization exercises:
  - Breathing techniques
  - Mindfulness practices
  - Emotional regulation tools
- Optional voice journaling (speech-to-text integration)
- Visualization modules (self-reflection graphs, summaries)

---

### Phase 3 ‚Äî AI Integration (Strictly Non-Clinical)

- Local-only AI models by default
- Optional API access (e.g. ChatGPT) ‚Äî fully transparent to user
- AI suggestions as journaling structure aids
- No clinical assessments, no diagnoses, no therapeutic authority
- No automated decision-making regarding user health or well-being

---

### Phase 4 ‚Äî System Expansion

- Portable installer and deployment tools for multiple hardware platforms
- Secure backup & restore functions (fully user-controlled)
- Multi-user support (family & home environments)
- Extended stabilization & self-regulation resources
- Self-hosted optional synchronization features (without cloud dependencies)
- Hardware abstraction for simplified Raspberry Pi & generic PC installations
- Long-term hardware platform extensions

---

## üìú Permanent Development Constraints

- No diagnostic, clinical, or therapeutic simulation functions.
- No external data harvesting or telemetry.
- 100% offline functionality by default.
- Full data sovereignty for users.
- 100% open-source transparency.
- Strict adherence to `ETHICS.md` for all contributors and modules.
- No monetization of personal data ‚Äî ever.

---

## ü§ù Community Contributions

Nous-OS welcomes open-source contributors who fully accept and comply with the ethical charter (`ETHICS.md`).

Every pull request will be reviewed for:

- Ethical compliance
- Privacy preservation
- Non-clinical scope adherence
- Technical stability

Nous-OS is not simply software ‚Äî  
It is a protected space for safe, autonomous inner work.
