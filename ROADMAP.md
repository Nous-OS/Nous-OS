# 🗺 Nous-OS Development Roadmap 1.0

---

Nous-OS is a privacy-first Linux-based digital laboratory for self-reflection, therapeutic journaling, and AI-assisted inner work.  
This roadmap outlines the development milestones for building Nous-OS step-by-step.

---

## Phase 1 — Core System (Minimal Functional Prototype)

- 🖥 Arch Linux ARM base (stable on Raspberry Pi 5)
- 🖥 Arch Linux x86 base (stable on Laptop/Desktop, dual-boot ready)
- 🎛 Lightweight desktop (initially XFCE, later bspwm/i3 optional)
- 🔐 Full disk encryption (LUKS for system and user data)
- 🖥 Basic bootscreen & placeholder branding

---

## Phase 2 — Journal Module (Therapeutic Core)

- 📓 Journaling backend with structured categories:
  - Dreams
  - Thoughts
  - Emotions
  - Body Observations
  - AI Reflections
- 📦 Encrypted & modular data structure (e.g. YAML/JSON + Markdown)
- 🖨 LaTeX export:
  - Layout design for high-quality printable journals
  - Local PDF export generation

---

## Phase 3 — AI-Assisted Reflection (Offline-First)

- 🔬 Whisper.cpp integration (local speech-to-text)
- 🔬 DeepSeek / LLaMA.cpp integration (local language models for AI reflections)
- 🔬 Basic pattern detection (e.g. recurring themes in dreams & thoughts)

---

## Phase 4 — Stabilization & Mindfulness Module

- 🧘 Breathing & relaxation exercises (local audio/visual modules)
- 🧠 Psychoeducational modules (offline knowledge base)
- 🔐 All data stored locally & encrypted

---

## Phase 5 — Installer & Distribution

- 💾 Initial Nous-Pi image (for Raspberry Pi 5)
- 💻 First x86 ISO image (for PC/Laptop)
- ⚙️ Minimal installer (script or GUI-based)
- 📄 Installation documentation added to repository

---

## Phase 6 — Public Visibility & Community Building

- 🌐 Setup GitHub docs/ directory
- 📓 Publish Journal Specification as Markdown
- 🌐 Create initial GitHub Pages project website
- 📸 Add screenshots & demo material as prototypes evolve
- 📢 Public Alpha Announcement

---

**Core Principles remain:**

- Offline-first  
- No cloud dependencies  
- Open-source & ethical  
- Step-by-step expansion

---

*Nous-OS helps you become the researcher of your own mind — so that human therapy can reach even deeper.*
